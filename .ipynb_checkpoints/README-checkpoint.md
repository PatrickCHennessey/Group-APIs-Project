# Group-APIs-Project
1 Page Project Proposal
 Team Members: Adithya Venkatesh, Darryl Baynes, Patrick Hennessey
 Project Description/Outline:
 	Our group will analyze several key metrics of various National Basketball Association (NBA) players. The key metrics that we will analyze will be a specific player’s height, their wingspan, and their free-throw percentage over a given season/career. From these key metrics we will create a ratio that will be applied to the historical best and worst free throw shooters.
         	Our group will also utilize box plots within our regression model to determine any outliers or anomalies when calculating the ratios of current NBA players.
         	Limitations have been put in place to filter out extreme anomalies including: **Minimum of 82 free throws attempted in a NBA season.**
 Research Questions to Answer:
         	To determine if there is a correlation between height, wingspan, and successful free throw attempts.    
	
 Datasets to be Used:
         	https://www.basketball-reference.com/
   	https://sportsdata.io/
         	https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/nba-players-data

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
         	Utilizing the Jira website, our group has compartmentalized the project into several “sprints” and within each sprint contains several sub-groupings or “tasks”. The first “Sprint”  we will Identify the datasets needed for the purposes of this project and ensure each group member is able to utilize through GitBash and/or Terminal the various git commands needed to contribute changes. The second process Data Analysis each member will parse through the data identifying key metrics used in our calculations. In the final “Data Visual” step we will create a script to illustrate our analysis of the data to the audience.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Questions for TA's:
Height & Wingspan vs # of Free Throws (controlled variable) & Free Throw% (controlled variable) in given year(s)Does number of FT affect win probability? Once established importance of FT. Best scenario in order to make FT.
Ex. Does Experience, Height/Wingspan, affect success rate of making FTAre taller people be the ones who take the free throws? Who is ideal player to take FT?Does higher nominal number of FT taken affect success of converting FT successfully? (edited)
